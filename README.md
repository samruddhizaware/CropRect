# CropRect
Crop Prediction ML Project

•	The proposed system takes seven parameters like N,P,K,temp,humidity, rainfall and pH values into consideration and determines which are the best productive crops that can be grown in that suitable soil conditions.
 
•	Since the system lists all potential crops it helps the farmer determine which crop to be grown in their area.


•	This system thus helps the farmer to decide on the maximum profitable crop and also helps in finding new crops that can be cultivated which have not been cultivated till that time by the farmer.
